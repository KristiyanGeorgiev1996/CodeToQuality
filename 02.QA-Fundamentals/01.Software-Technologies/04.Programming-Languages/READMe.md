# 🖥️ Programming Languages

Coding, or programming, is the way we give instructions to a computer 💻. Each line of code represents a command, and several commands together form a **program or source code** 📝. For example, we can calculate a value or display the result on the screen using a simple line of code like `console.log(3+5)` ✨. Programming is essentially the art of structuring these instructions so that the computer can execute them efficiently ⚡. Programs can be small and simple, like calculating a number, or huge, like social networks or games 🎮.

Programming languages are formal languages with strict rules and syntax 📚 that allow us to write these instructions. They can be categorized into different types – **low-level** languages, which work close to the hardware and are harder to understand 🛠️, and **high-level** languages, which are more abstract and closer to human language 🗣️, making them easier to write and maintain. There’s also a difference between **scripting** and **compiled** languages: scripting languages are executed line by line by an interpreter 🐍, while compiled languages are converted to machine code before execution ⚡, making them faster but stricter in syntax.

The history of programming starts with **machine code** in the 1940s – binary instructions executed directly by the CPU 🖥️. Later, in the 1950s, **assembly language** appeared, using short symbolic codes instead of binary numbers, making it easier to read 📜. In the late 1950s and 1960s, the first high-level languages emerged, such as **Fortran** for scientific calculations 🔬, **COBOL** for business applications 📊, and **BASIC**, designed for education 🎓 and easy to learn.

In the following decades, modern languages we use today emerged 🌟. **C** is a powerful language for system programming ⚙️, while **C++** adds object-oriented features and is suitable for high-performance applications and games 🎮. **Python** is beginner-friendly 🐍, suitable for Web 🌐, Data Science 📊, and Artificial Intelligence 🤖, while **Java** is cross-platform and often used for Web and mobile applications 📱. **JavaScript** is used for interactive web pages and can run both on the client and server 🌐. **C#** is a versatile language for business apps 💼, Web 🌐, and mobile apps 📱. Other popular languages include **PHP**, **Go**, **TypeScript**, **Swift**, **Kotlin**, **Rust**, **Ruby**, **Dart**, and **Perl**.

The difference between **low-level** and **high-level** languages is fundamental – low-level code gives direct control over the hardware 🛠️ but is harder to write and read 📉, whereas high-level languages let us write less code 📝 that is easier to maintain and understand 🧠. Similarly, scripting languages are flexible and dynamic 🌈, while compiled languages are faster and more stable ⚡.

To write and run programs, we use **IDEs** – Integrated Development Environments 🛠️. They help us write code, run it, and debug 🐞, often offering syntax highlighting 🎨, autocomplete ✨, and plugins 🔌. Popular IDEs include **Visual Studio** for C# 🖥️, **PyCharm** for Python 🐍, **IntelliJ IDEA** for Java ☕, and **WebStorm** for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 🌐. **VS Code** is a universal and free editor 📝 that supports almost all languages and extensions ⚡.

In **front-end development**, HTML creates the page structure 🏗️, CSS styles the elements 🎨, and JavaScript adds interactivity ⚡. For example, we can center a heading or calculate a value using simple scripts with variables 📝, conditional statements ❓, and functions 🔄. The same JavaScript code can run in the browser 🌐 or on the server via **Node.js**, which uses the **V8 engine** ⚡ and **npm packages** 📦 for dependency management.

To experiment with **real projects**, we can clone and run examples like [nakov/MVC-app-integration-tests-example-mocha](https://github.com/nakov/MVC-app-integration-tests-example-mocha) 🚀. The project runs using `npm install`, `npm test`, and `npm start`, allowing us to see how a complete Node.js web application works and how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript come together 🌐💻.
