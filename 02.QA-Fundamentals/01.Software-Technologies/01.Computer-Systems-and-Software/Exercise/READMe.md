## 🌍 Part 1: Travel Bucket List

### Task Description
You will create a personal Trello board that visualizes the destinations you’d like to visit around the world.  
This project helps you practice organizing ideas using Trello boards, lists, and cards.

### Steps
1. Create a **new Trello board** titled **“Travel Bucket List”** (do not use any templates).  
2. Add a **separate list** for each continent or region you’d like to visit.  
   - Example: *Europe*, *Australia*, *Asia*, etc.  
3. Under each list, create **three cards**, each representing a country, city, or location you’d love to explore.  
   - Example: Under “Europe” → *Paris*, *Italy*, *Fishing Village in Portugal*.  
4. Use the **label feature** to categorize your destinations by type — *Beach*, *Adventure*, *Culture*, *Nature*, *Hobby*, etc.  
5. In each card’s **description**, include must-see attractions or experiences you’d like to do there.  
6. Add **due dates** for the destinations you plan to visit within the next 5 years.  
7. Take a **screenshot of your full board** and replace the example photo with it.  
8. Take another **screenshot of one card** (showing its labels, description, and due date) and add it below.
