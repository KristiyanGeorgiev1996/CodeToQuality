# 📘 Computer Systems and Software  

## 📝 Overview  
A computer system is a combination of **hardware** and **software** that work together to enable data input, processing, and output. It is the foundation of modern technology – from smartphones and laptops to IoT devices and cloud services.

## 💻 Hardware  
- 🧠 **CPU** – the "brain" of the computer that executes instructions and manages processes.  
- 🧮 **CPU Components**:  
  - CU (Control Unit) – manages instruction flow.  
  - ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) – performs arithmetic and logical operations.  
  - MU (Memory Unit) – stores data and instructions during execution.  
- 📝 **Memory**:  
  - RAM – temporary storage for data and running programs.  
  - ROM – stores essential boot instructions.  
  - Cache – very fast memory inside the CPU.  
  - Secondary storage – HDD, SSD, USB, optical drives.  
- 🔌 **Motherboard** – the central hub that connects all hardware components. Contains slots for CPU, RAM, expansion cards, and controllers.  
- ⌨️ **Peripheral devices**:  
  - Input: keyboard, mouse, microphone.  
  - Output: monitor, printer, speakers.  
  - Input/Output: network card, hard drive, touchscreen.  
- 🔧 **Controllers & Drivers** – connect peripherals with the system and enable communication.

## 🖥 Software  
- 📌 **Firmware** – embedded low-level software stored in hardware (BIOS, routers, IoT devices). Controls basic operations and can be updated.  
- ⚙️ **System Software** – manages hardware and provides a platform for applications:  
  - Operating Systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android).  
  - Drivers (connect hardware with the OS).  
  - Utilities (antivirus, disk cleanup, Task Manager).  
  - Hypervisors (virtual machines).  
- 📂 **Application Software** – programs designed for end users:  
  - Business tools (Office, CRM, ERP).  
  - Communication apps (Zoom, WhatsApp, Teams).  
  - Multimedia (Photoshop, VLC).  
  - Web browsers and games.  
- 🌐 **Server-Side Software (Backend)** – handles data and services:  
  - Web servers (Apache, Nginx).  
  - Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL).  
  - Mail and file servers.  
  - Cloud services and APIs.  
- 🎨 **Frontend & Backend** – client-side UI works together with server-side logic via protocols like HTTP.

## 📱 Types of Applications  
- 🌍 **Web Apps** – run in a browser, require no installation, always up to date, cross-platform.  
- 💻 **Desktop Apps** – installed locally, often more feature-rich, can work offline, better performance.  
- 📲 **Mobile Apps** – designed for smartphones/tablets, use device features (GPS, camera), work online/offline.
