# 🧪 Testing Techniques

---

Testing techniques are systematic approaches used in software testing to detect defects, optimize resources, and ensure quality in complex systems. 🛠️ We use different techniques because software can vary greatly, and different defects require different strategies. Testing can be divided into **static** and **dynamic** approaches.

**Static testing** 🖋️ focuses on analyzing code, requirements, and design without executing the software. Its main goal is early defect detection and prevention. It includes reviewing documents and code, performing walkthroughs, inspections, peer reviews, and static analysis. These methods help teams catch errors, improve knowledge sharing, reduce rework, and save time. Tools like **SonarQube** support static analysis by checking code quality, security, and complexity.

**Dynamic testing** 🚀 involves executing the software to observe its behavior and validate functionality, performance, and reliability. Dynamic testing can be **structure-based (white-box)**, **specification-based (black-box)**, or **experience-based (grey-box)**. White-box testing examines the internal structure of the code to increase coverage, black-box testing focuses on inputs and outputs without considering the internal logic, and experience-based testing leverages tester knowledge, intuition, and creativity to uncover hidden defects.

Experience-based techniques like exploratory testing, error guessing, checklist-based testing, and random (monkey) testing provide flexibility and adaptability, especially when documentation is incomplete or the system is complex. 🌟

Choosing the right test technique depends on project needs, system complexity, available resources, and the testers’ expertise. Often, combining static, dynamic, and experience-based approaches ensures better coverage and higher software quality. ✅
