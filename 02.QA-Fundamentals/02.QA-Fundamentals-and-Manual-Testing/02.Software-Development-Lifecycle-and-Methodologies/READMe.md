# 🖥️ Software Development Lifecycle & Methodologies

Software development is a full process that starts with ideas and requirements and goes through various stages – design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance 💡. Everything begins with **software requirements** (SRS – Software Requirements Specification), which describe what the system should do, not how to do it. Requirements are divided into functional, defining specific actions and capabilities of the system, and non-functional, covering performance, security, scalability, integrations, and constraints 🌟.  

Requirements are never fixed – they change throughout the development process. Well-defined requirements, supported by user interface prototypes, save time and reduce the need for changes later. Agile methodologies provide flexibility and adaptability to continuously evolving requirements ⚡.

## 🔄 Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

The **SDLC** outlines the stages a software project goes through to ensure quality, functionality, and stability. First comes **requirements analysis**, where client needs are clarified and documented through SRS or user stories. Next is **design**, covering both system architecture – databases, relationships, and structures – and software design – interfaces, technology choices, and detailed specifications.  

During the **development phase**, developers build the software, write code, debug, review, and integrate modules. The code is the heart of the process and follows the architecture and design decisions. **Unit tests** are an important part of this phase, ensuring that individual components work correctly.

After that, **testing** checks if the developed software meets the requirements, identifies defects, and ensures quality. QA engineers plan and execute tests, design test scenarios and cases, prepare environments, and log issues 🐞. Automated testing and CI/CD practices accelerate the process and reduce error risks.

**Deployment** moves the software from developers to users. This can be a web app, mobile app, or desktop application. Deployment involves compiling, packaging, installing, and configuring software across different environments – development, test, staging, and production ☁️. Continuous Deployment (CD) allows automatic release after each code commit.

Finally, **maintenance** involves updating the system after release, fixing bugs, adding new features, and adapting to changing business needs or new technologies. The typical workflow includes analysis, requirement updates, backlog prioritization, design, coding, QA, and redeployment 🔄.

## 📊 Development Methodologies

There are different methodologies for software development. **Heavyweight (Plan-Driven) methods** like Waterfall or V-Model rely on detailed documentation and formal processes. They work well when requirements are stable but are less flexible to change.  

**Agile methodologies**, on the other hand, are lightweight and iterative. They break development into small cycles (iterations), where small portions of software are developed, tested, and delivered quickly. Agile emphasizes **customer collaboration, frequent increments, and adaptability to change**. The goal is to deliver working software continuously rather than waiting for complete documentation 🌟.

### 🏃 Scrum

Scrum is a popular Agile framework. It divides work into short sprints of 2-4 weeks. Each sprint goes through planning, execution, review, and retrospective. Scrum defines three main roles:  

- **Product Owner** – defines the product vision, manages the Product Backlog and priorities, represents customer interests.  
- **Scrum Master** – facilitator who removes obstacles, ensures Scrum principles are followed, and supports team productivity.  
- **Development Team** – cross-functional team responsible for delivering usable increments, maintaining quality, and adapting daily plans ⚡.

Scrum uses artifacts like the **Product Backlog**, which contains all product requirements, and the **Sprint Backlog**, which contains tasks for the current sprint. Each iteration produces a **Product Increment** – a working portion of the product that can be demonstrated or released, but is not the final version.  

Scrum events include **Sprint Planning** – planning tasks for the sprint, **Daily Scrum** – short daily stand-up meetings for team synchronization, **Sprint Review** – demonstrating completed increments, and **Sprint Retrospective** – reflecting on the sprint and improving processes.  

Agile and Scrum make software development flexible, customer-oriented, and efficient, while reducing risks and ensuring fast delivery of valuable software 💼🚀.
