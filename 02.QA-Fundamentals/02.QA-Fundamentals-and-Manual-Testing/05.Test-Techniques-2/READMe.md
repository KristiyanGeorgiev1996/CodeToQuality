# 🧪 Testing Techniques II

---

Black-box testing, also known as specification-based or behavioral testing, evaluates software functionality without knowing the internal code. 🖥️💡 Testers focus on inputs and expected outputs, ensuring the software behaves according to requirements ✅. It is versatile, requires no programming knowledge 📝, and is suitable for web 🌐, database 🗄️, and other systems. Test cases are derived from user stories 📖, design documents 🖊️, or external specifications, and black-box testing can be automated ⚙️ for efficiency across unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing (UAT) 👥.

One widely used method in black-box testing is **Equivalence Partitioning (EP)** 📊, which divides input data into valid and invalid partitions. Testers select representative values from each partition to reduce the number of test cases while ensuring coverage ✅. **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)** 🔍 complements EP by focusing on the edges of these partitions, testing values at, just below, and just above boundaries to detect edge-case defects ⚠️.

**Decision Table Testing** 📑 connects conditions with their corresponding actions. It helps manage complex business rules by systematically defining combinations of inputs and expected outcomes 🎯. This technique is particularly effective for ensuring all logical paths are considered 🔗 and for simplifying the testing of conditional requirements 🛠️.

**Pairwise Testing** 🤝, or All-Pairs testing, reduces the number of test cases needed when multiple parameters are involved. By testing combinations of parameter pairs rather than all possibilities, testers can efficiently detect most defects 🐞 with fewer tests, maintaining reasonable coverage 🎯.

**State Transition Testing** 🔄 evaluates systems with finite states, verifying that transitions between states occur correctly in response to events ⚡. It identifies incorrect state changes ❌ and unexpected behavior 🌀, ensuring the system behaves as intended in all scenarios ✅.

**Use-Case Testing** 🧩 focuses on the system’s functionality from the user’s perspective 👤. Each use case describes a sequence of actions by an actor to achieve a specific goal 🎯. Testing ensures the system handles transactions end-to-end 🔄, identifies integration issues ⚠️, and validates the overall user experience 🌟. Pre-conditions define what must be true before the use case starts 🔑, while post-conditions confirm the system’s state after completion ✅.

Choosing the appropriate testing technique depends on the system 🖥️, risk level ⚠️, development lifecycle 🔄, objectives 🎯, time ⏱️, budget 💰, and tester experience 👩‍💻👨‍💻. Structure-based techniques are ideal for detecting code errors 🐛, specification-based for missing or incomplete functionality 📝, and experience-based techniques are effective when documentation or code is incomplete 📚. Combining techniques often provides the most comprehensive defect coverage 🏆.
