# 🛡️ Security Testing - Lecture Overview  

## 🌐 1. Security Testing: Overview and Concepts  

Security testing is the process of evaluating a software application to ensure that its data and resources are protected against unauthorized access and vulnerabilities. The main objective is to identify potential weaknesses and ensure the application complies with security requirements. 🔐  

### Key Elements:
- **Confidentiality** – ensuring data is only accessible to authorized users 🕵️  
- **Integrity** – maintaining data accuracy and consistency  
- **Availability** – ensuring system and data are accessible when needed  

### Principles:
- **Least Privilege** – users should have only the permissions necessary for their tasks  
- **Defense in Depth** – multiple layers of security controls to protect resources  
- **Fail Securely** – the system should handle failures without compromising security  

### Types of Security Testing:
- **Vulnerability Scanning** – automatic detection of known vulnerabilities  
- **Penetration Testing** – simulating attacks to identify exploitable weaknesses  
- **Risk Assessment** – evaluating potential impact of security threats  
- **Security Auditing** – reviewing code, architecture, and configuration for security compliance

## 🛠️ 2. Security Testing Tools  

Security testing tools help automate the identification of vulnerabilities and assist in protecting applications. They can perform scanning, monitoring, and simulation of attacks. Common tools include:  
- **OWASP ZAP** – open-source web application security scanner  
- **Burp Suite** – comprehensive testing platform for web apps  
- **Nmap** – network exploration and vulnerability scanning tool  

These tools are essential for modern software development to maintain robust security standards. ⚡

## 🕵️ 3. OWASP ZAP – Popular Security Testing Tool  

OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) is a widely-used open-source tool for detecting security vulnerabilities in web applications. Key features include:  
- Automated scanners for common vulnerabilities  
- Manual testing tools for in-depth analysis  
- Support for REST APIs and modern web frameworks  
- Proxying and intercepting HTTP/HTTPS traffic for inspection  

ZAP is beginner-friendly while also providing advanced options for experienced security testers. It is ideal for integrating security checks into the development lifecycle. 🔎

## ⚠️ 4. Security Attacks  

Understanding common security attacks is crucial for effective testing. Examples include:  
- **SQL Injection** – manipulating database queries through input fields  
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** – injecting malicious scripts into web pages  
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** – tricking users into executing unwanted actions  
- **Brute Force Attacks** – attempting many password combinations to gain access  

Security testing aims to detect these attacks and implement countermeasures to prevent data breaches and maintain system integrity. 🛡️

### 🏁 Conclusion  

Security testing is a critical part of the software development lifecycle. By combining automated tools, manual assessment, and understanding of attack techniques, organizations can safeguard their applications against threats, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 🚀
