# 🧪 Introduction to Software Quality Assurance (SQA)

**SQA (QA)** is a process that ensures software behaves according to the requirements.  
Its core activity is **testing** – manual or automated, with defects tracked through *bug tracking systems* and often integrated into **CI/CD pipelines**.

## 🔍 Software Testing
Testing evaluates software quality, checks compliance with requirements, and identifies bugs.  

**Main goals:**
- ✅ Prevent defects  
- ✅ Verify requirements and expected behavior  
- ✅ Reduce risks  
- ✅ Provide information to stakeholders

## 🔄 Testing Process
1. 📋 **Planning** – what, when, and how testing will be performed.  
2. 🛠 **Design** – creating test scenarios and test cases.  
3. ⚙️ **Environment setup** – configuration and test data preparation.  
4. ▶️ **Execution** – running the tests.  
5. 📑 **Reporting** – logging results and defects.

## 🐞 Defects (Bugs)
- **Error** – human mistake.  
- **Defect (Bug)** – issue in code, design, or requirements.  
- **Failure** – when a defect manifests during execution.  

**Common causes of defects:**  
⏳ lack of time · 📚 insufficient training · 🧩 complex code · ❓ unclear requirements · ⚠️ misconfiguration

## 🤖 Manual vs Automated Testing
- 🖐 **Manual** → performed by QA specialists, slower, limited coverage.  
- ⚙️ **Automated** → using scripts and tools, faster, scalable, broader coverage.

## 📜 Principles of Testing
1. Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence.  
2. Exhaustive testing is impossible → prioritization is needed.  
3. Early testing saves time and costs.  
4. Defects cluster in a small number of modules (Pareto principle).  
5. Repeating the same tests reduces their effectiveness.  
6. Testing depends on context.  
7. Lack of defects ≠ successful product.

## 🧩 Test Scenarios and Test Cases
- **Test Scenario** → a feature or user story to be tested.  
- **Test Case** → specific steps with input and expected output (positive/negative).
