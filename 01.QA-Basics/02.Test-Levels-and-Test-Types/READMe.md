# 📌 Software Testing: Levels and Types

In the world of software testing, different levels and types of tests ensure applications work correctly and meet user expectations.  

## 🧩 Unit Testing  
The first step is **unit testing**, which checks individual components like functions, methods, or modules. This is mainly done by developers during coding to catch and fix bugs early.  

## 🔗 Integration Testing  
Once individual parts work independently, **integration testing** verifies how they behave together. The goal is to ensure proper interaction between modules and detect issues in their connections.  

## 🖥️ System Testing  
**System testing** focuses on the entire system: its behavior, capabilities, reliability, and performance. QA specialists check whether all components work smoothly together and whether the system is ready for real-world conditions.  

## ✅ Acceptance Testing   
At the final level, **acceptance testing** checks the product from the perspective of end users or the business. It ensures the system meets client expectations and regulatory requirements.  

## ⚡ Types of Testing  

### 🔹 Functional Testing  
This tests **what the system does**. The main goal is to confirm the software works correctly according to requirements.  

### 🔹 Non-Functional Testing 
This evaluates **how the system performs** – reliability, efficiency, security, and user-friendliness. The goal is to improve product quality and ensure a smooth user experience.
