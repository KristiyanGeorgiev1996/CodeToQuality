# 🐞 Software Bugs in Testing

## 🌐 Introduction
🌐 In the world of software testing, defects, known as bugs, are inevitable because humans make mistakes. A software bug represents an issue in the program that causes the application to behave incorrectly or not perform its intended function. Early detection and fixing of these errors is important, as over time they can lead to serious damage or hide other bugs. 🐞

## 📄 Bug Report
📄 The bug report is a document that describes the discovered bug in detail: how it manifests, under what conditions, expected vs actual behavior, environment, steps to reproduce, and additional evidence like screenshots or videos. Each bug is assessed by severity, which shows how strongly it affects the product's operation, and by priority, which determines how quickly it should be fixed. For example, a blocking bug without a workaround has high severity and often high priority, while a cosmetic issue may have low values for both. ⚡

## 🔄 Defect Life Cycle
🔄 The defect life cycle tracks the entire process from discovery to final closure. A bug starts as new and is confirmed by QA, then assigned to a developer for fixing. After the fix, it is tested, and if everything is fine, it is marked as closed. However, the bug may reappear, be duplicated, or rejected. ❗

## 🛠️ Bug Tracking Systems
🛠️ For more effective management, defect tracking systems like Jira, GitHub Issues, or BugZilla are used. They allow storage, categorization, and tracking of bugs across projects, facilitate teamwork, and improve problem analysis to prevent future errors. ✅
