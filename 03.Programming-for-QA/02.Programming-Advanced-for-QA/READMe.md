# ðŸ“˜ Programming Advanced for QA

This course dives deeper into programming concepts, covering **associative arrays, lambda expressions, LINQ, regular expressions**, and **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, including **classes, objects, inheritance, and interfaces**.  

Participants will learn to define and use classes and objects, and explore advanced topics such as **static members, generic types**, and **exceptions**. The course culminates in a **hands-on project**, where learners implement an OOP-based solution, navigate its structure, and test it using established coding best practices and methodologies.  

Throughout the course, learners gain practical experience through exercises designed to reinforce key concepts and ensure readiness for real-world applications in QA automation.
