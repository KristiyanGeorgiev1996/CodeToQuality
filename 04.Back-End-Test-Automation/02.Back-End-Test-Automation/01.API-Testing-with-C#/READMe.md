# üß© API Testing with C# ‚Äì Lecture Overview

## 1. Understanding APIs

API (Application Programming Interface) is an interface that allows different applications to communicate with each other.

- Key concepts: requests, responses, endpoints, methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) ‚ö°  
- Developers use APIs to integrate functionalities between different systems.

## 2. Serialization and Deserialization

Serialization is the process of converting objects into a standard format (e.g., JSON) that can be transmitted or stored.  
Deserialization is the reverse process ‚Äì converting JSON or another format back into objects for use in code.

- This allows easy handling of API data and communication between applications.

## 3. API Testing with C#

API testing in C# is typically performed using **NUnit** for the testing framework and **RestSharp** for sending HTTP requests.

- **GitHub API Requests** ‚Äì examples of interacting with real APIs via GET, POST, and other methods.  
- **NUnit + RestSharp** ‚Äì used for automating API tests, validating responses, and checking status codes.

### üèÅ Conclusion

API Testing with C# combines knowledge of API interaction, serialization/deserialization, and the use of tools like NUnit and RestSharp. This allows developers to test integration and ensure the reliability of their applications. üöÄ
