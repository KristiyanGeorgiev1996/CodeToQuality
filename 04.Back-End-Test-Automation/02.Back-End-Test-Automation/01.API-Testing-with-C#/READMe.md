# üß© API Testing with C# ‚Äì Lecture Overview

## 1. Understanding APIs

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software systems to communicate with each other.  

APIs are essential in modern software development because they allow applications to exchange data and functionality without exposing internal implementation details.  

- **Requests and Responses**: Every API interaction involves sending a request and receiving a response. The request specifies what the client wants, while the response provides the requested data or a status indicating the result.  
- **Endpoints**: These are specific URLs representing resources or services that can be accessed via the API.  
- **HTTP Methods**: Commonly used methods include GET (retrieve data), POST (create data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (remove data).  

Understanding these concepts is critical for designing reliable API tests and ensuring applications can integrate smoothly with other systems. ‚ö°

## 2. Serialization and Deserialization

Serialization is the process of converting an object in memory into a format that can be transmitted or stored, typically JSON or XML.  

Deserialization is the reverse process ‚Äì transforming structured data received from an API back into objects that can be used in your program.  

These processes are fundamental in API testing because:  
- They allow developers to easily handle structured data in their code.  
- They ensure that the data exchanged between client and server maintains integrity.  
- They enable automated validation of API responses against expected values.

## 3. API Testing with C#

In C#, API testing is typically achieved using **NUnit** as the testing framework and **RestSharp** as the HTTP client for sending requests and handling responses.  

This approach provides several advantages:  
- **Automation**: Tests can be executed automatically as part of a CI/CD pipeline, ensuring APIs remain reliable after every code change.  
- **Validation**: Responses can be checked for correct status codes, expected data, and correct serialization formats.  
- **Integration Testing**: By testing against real API endpoints, developers can verify that their application integrates correctly with external systems.  

**GitHub API Requests** are a common example to demonstrate API testing. They allow developers to interact with real-world APIs, test authentication, and validate data returned by the service.  

Using **NUnit + RestSharp** provides a structured way to organize tests, assert correctness of API responses, and handle errors efficiently. This makes testing robust, maintainable, and repeatable.

### üèÅ Conclusion

API Testing with C# is more than just sending HTTP requests ‚Äì it is about ensuring that applications communicate reliably, handle data correctly, and maintain integrity across different systems.  

By combining a strong understanding of APIs, proper serialization and deserialization, and tools like NUnit and RestSharp, developers can write thorough tests that increase confidence in their applications. üöÄ
