# 📊 Application Monitoring – Lecture Overview

## 1. App Monitoring

Application Monitoring is the process of **tracking the health, performance, and availability of software applications** in real-time.  

The main goals of monitoring are:  
- Detect issues before they affect users  
- Analyze system performance and trends  
- Ensure reliability and uptime of applications ⚡  

Monitoring includes metrics like response time, error rates, CPU/memory usage, and network activity. It is essential for proactive maintenance and optimizing user experience.

## 2. Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit widely used for **collecting and storing metrics** from applications and infrastructure.  

- It uses a **time-series database** to store data efficiently.  
- Provides a powerful query language (PromQL) to extract and analyze metrics.  
- Integrates easily with containerized environments like Kubernetes.  

Prometheus enables teams to track application performance and detect anomalies quickly. 🛠️

## 3. Alerting

Alerting is the mechanism of **notifying teams when a system or application exceeds predefined thresholds** or encounters errors.  

- Alerts can be sent via email, Slack, SMS, or other notification channels.  
- Helps ensure that issues are addressed promptly before they impact users.  
- Integrates with Prometheus and other monitoring tools to automate the alerting process. 🚨

## 4. Grafana

Grafana is an open-source visualization and analytics platform that **turns monitoring data into dashboards**.  

- Allows real-time visualization of metrics collected from Prometheus, ElasticStack, and other sources.  
- Supports custom dashboards, alerts, and trend analysis.  
- Helps teams quickly understand system health and performance. 📈

## 5. ElasticStack (ELK Stack)

ElasticStack, also known as the ELK Stack, is a set of tools for **collecting, storing, analyzing, and visualizing logs and metrics**.  

- **Elasticsearch** – a powerful search and analytics engine  
- **Logstash** – data collection and processing pipeline  
- **Kibana** – dashboard and visualization tool  

ElasticStack allows teams to monitor application logs, detect issues, and gain insights into system behavior. 🖥️
