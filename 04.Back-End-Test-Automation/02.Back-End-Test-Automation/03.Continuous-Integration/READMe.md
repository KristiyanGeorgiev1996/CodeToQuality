# üîÑ Continuous Integration (CI) ‚Äì Lecture Overview

## 1. The CI/CD Pipelines

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository. Each merge triggers an automated process that builds, tests, and validates the changes.  

A **CI/CD pipeline** is the automated workflow that ensures code quality and reliability throughout development:  
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** ‚Äì automatically build and test code after every commit to detect errors early.  
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)** ‚Äì automatically deploy code to staging or production environments once tests pass.  
- **Continuous Deployment** ‚Äì a fully automated deployment to production whenever a change is merged.  

Key benefits of CI pipelines include:  
- Early detection of bugs and integration issues  
- Faster feedback for developers  
- Reduced manual effort and human error

## 2. GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a cloud-based platform integrated with GitHub that allows developers to define **workflow automation** directly in their repositories.  

- Workflows are defined using YAML files and can include steps like building code, running tests, and deploying applications.  
- GitHub Actions supports event-driven triggers, such as push, pull request, or schedule-based executions.  
- It provides easy integration with other tools and services in the DevOps ecosystem.  

Using GitHub Actions, teams can implement CI pipelines without the need for external servers, making it ideal for small to medium projects. ‚ö°

## 3. Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used for implementing CI/CD pipelines.  

- Jenkins allows defining jobs and pipelines that automatically build, test, and deploy code.  
- It supports a vast range of plugins to integrate with different tools, version control systems, and deployment targets.  
- Jenkins pipelines can be configured using **Declarative Pipeline** or **Scripted Pipeline**, providing flexibility for complex workflows.  

Key advantages of Jenkins include:  
- Highly customizable and extensible  
- Supports large-scale enterprise projects  
- Strong community support

### üèÅ Conclusion

Continuous Integration is a critical practice in modern software development, ensuring that code changes are consistently validated and integrated.  

Tools like **GitHub Actions** and **Jenkins** provide robust automation capabilities for CI/CD pipelines, reducing errors, increasing development speed, and improving overall software quality. üöÄ
