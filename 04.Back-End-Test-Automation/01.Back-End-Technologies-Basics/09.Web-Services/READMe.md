# 🌐 Web Services – Lecture Overview

## 1. HTTP Overview

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the main protocol for communication between web clients and servers. It defines the rules for sending requests and receiving responses in the web environment. ⚡

### Key Features:
- **Methods** – GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH  
- **Status Codes** – 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error)  
- **Headers and Bodies** – contain information about the request or response  

---

## 2. HTTP Developer Tools

Developers use tools to analyze and debug HTTP requests:  
- **Browser DevTools** – inspect network requests and responses  
- **cURL** – command-line tool for testing HTTP requests  
- **Fiddler / Wireshark** – detailed analysis of network packets  

---

## 3. Introduction to RESTful Services

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for creating web services based on HTTP.

- **Resources** – each piece of information has a unique URL  
- **CRUD operations** – represented through HTTP methods  
- **Statelessness** – each request contains all the necessary information  

---

## 4. Authentication and Authorization in RESTful APIs

Security in RESTful APIs is ensured through:  
- **Authentication** – verifying the identity of the user (e.g., tokens, keys)  
- **Authorization** – defining access rights to resources  

Popular approaches: API keys, OAuth 2.0, JWT (JSON Web Tokens) 🔐

## 5. Postman Overview

Postman is a tool for testing APIs that allows:  
- Sending HTTP requests with different methods  
- Configuring headers, parameters, and bodies  
- Saving collections and automating tests  

---

## 6. Swagger

Swagger is a tool for documenting and testing RESTful APIs. It allows:  
- Automatic generation of documentation  
- Visual exploration of endpoints  
- Interactive testing of API methods  

---

### 🏁 Conclusion

Developing and testing web services relies on the HTTP protocol and REST architecture. Tools like Postman and Swagger help developers verify, document, and debug APIs efficiently. 🚀
