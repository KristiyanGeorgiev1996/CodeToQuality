# 🧪 API Testing with Postman – Lecture Overview

## 1. Postman Recap

Postman is a powerful tool for API testing that allows sending HTTP requests, configuring headers and parameters, and analyzing responses. ⚡

---

## 2. Key Terms

- **Request** – a call to an API  
- **Response** – the answer returned by the API  
- **Endpoint** – a specific URL to which the request is sent  
- **Collection** – a group of requests organized together  
- **Environment** – a set of variables for different testing environments  

---

## 3. Postman's Scripting API

Postman provides a JavaScript-based interface for scripting:  
- **Pre-request scripts** – run before the request  
- **Tests scripts** – run after the request to validate responses  

---

## 4. Writing Basic API Tests

Common validations include:  
- Checking the response status code (e.g., 200 OK)  
- Validating the structure and content of JSON responses  
- Checking specific fields and values  

---

## 5. Error Handling

When testing APIs, it is important to anticipate errors:  
- Checking status codes like 400 or 500  
- Handling invalid data  
- Logging errors for easier debugging  

---

## 6. Best Practices

- Organize requests into collections  
- Use variables for different environments  
- Automate tests with scripts  
- Regularly update tests when APIs change  

---

### 🏁 Conclusion

Postman is a powerful tool for both automated and manual API testing. By writing tests, using scripts, and managing collections effectively, developers can ensure the reliability and correctness of their APIs. 🚀
